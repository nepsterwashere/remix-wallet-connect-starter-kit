# Wallet Connect Starter Kit

This Starter Kits shows how you can connect a browser with some of the main wallets available in Cardano by implementing a simple [Remix](https://remix.run) application.

It implements some of the methods defined in the [CIP-30 Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip30/) for showing the wallet state and information in the web browser.

This kit should be easy to extend for supporting new Wallets and implement the missing methods defined in the CIP-30.
